Stat Review Problem Set This   problem set is designed to provide a review of basic statistics based on actual data.   You are expected   to work individually, and your answer should be turned in by emailing it to uicﬁ[email   protected] with   subject   line “assignment: stat   review from   ABC,” where   ABC   is your   name. The assignment   is   due   by   6 pm   on   2/9/2024   Answers   may   be   in   the   form   of   a Word or   Excel   ﬁle, though I prefer   the latter.
I.                            [A.]   Download   DAILY   adjusted   closing   prices   [from   1/1/2018   to   1/31/2024]   from   Yahoo   Finance for   the   following   tickers:      SPY,   GBF,   SDS,   TBT,   EEM.
[B.]   Plot   historical   prices   for   the   ﬁve   ETFs   on   the   same   line   chart.
[Note:      remember   to   compute   returns   on   the   ﬁve   ETFs   ﬁrst   for   the   following   questions. The   return   series   should   start   at   1/2/2018]
[Hint:      SDS   and   TBT   are   leveraged   ETFs][C.] A portfolio is designed to gain exposure to US and international stocks and bonds by allocating   40% to SDS, 30% to TBT, and 30% to EEM. Compute the mean, standard deviation, skewness,   kurtosis,   and   Sharpe   Ratio of this portfolio   and the three   ETFs   (SDS,   TBT,   and   EEM).   Sharpe   Ratio   is   deﬁned   as   the   ratio   of mean   to   standard   deviation   (assuming   risk   free   rate   is   zero).[D.]   A   130/30   trading   strategy   means   shorting   an   asset   up   t代 写Investments Spring 2024

Compute the mean,   standard   deviation,   skewness,   and   Sharpe   Ratio   of this   portfolio.    Compare   this   portfolio   to   the   one   in   C.,   what   do   you   observe?
[E.]   A   portfolio   is   constructed   by   investing   60%   in   SPY   and   40%   in   GBF.   Compute   the   mean,   standard   deviation,   skewness,   and   Sharpe   Ratio   of   this   portfolio   and   both   SPY   and   GBF.   Compare this   portfolio   to   the   one   in   C.   and   D.,   what   do   you   observe?    [Hint:    How   much   return   each   fund   can   get   for   one   unit   of risk?] 
[F.]   Regress   SDS   on   SPY   and   TBT   on   GBF   and   draw   the   following   two   scatter   plots:    SPY   vs   SDS   and   TBT   vs   GBF.   What   are   your   observations?
II.    Janice   wants   to   buy   stock   A   whose   return   shows   a   mean   of 2%   and   a   standard   deviation   of 4%   based   on   250   daily   returns.   At   the   .05   level   of signiﬁcance   (or   95%   conﬁdence   level),   she   would   like   to   test   if the stock’s daily return is   equal   to   5%.    (a)   write   out   the   null   and   alternative   hypothesis.    (b)   Compute   the   test   statistic.    (c)   Should   she   reject   or   fail   to   reject   the   null   hypothesis?
